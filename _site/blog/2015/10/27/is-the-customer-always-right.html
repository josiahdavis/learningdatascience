<p>Slogans, or common sayings, are by definition everywhere. They are used in business, marketing, political campaigns, and in our everyday life to highlight something of importance. But all slogans deserve qualification. Take the common phrase: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush”, which means that it’s better to have a garaunteed small reward than to take a risk for a large reward. And this is generally true. But there are also situations where the principle doesn’t apply, such as starting a new retailing business, for instance. In some cases, the risk of losing the bird for the chance of catching the two might be worth taking.</p>

<h2 id="caveat-emptor-no-more">“Caveat Emptor” No More</h2>
<p>In the United States, the credit for the slogan “The Customer Is Always Right” is usually given to Marshall Field, a business retail magnate during the period of America’s Gilded Age. The company he helped build, Marshall Field’s (originally P. Palmer &amp; Co.), pioneered several retail practices that are now considered common in retail, including: giving customers access to a free personal shopper, the one-price price-tag, no-questions-asked returns, and the bridal registry. At a time when the typical retail experience was best defined by the axiom Caveat Emptor -  a latin term meaning “let the buyer beware” - Marshall Field’s marked a radical departure from the status quo.</p>

<p>For over 150 years, Marshall Field’s maintained its reputation as an upscale department store despite changing owners multiple times in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2005 Federated Department Stores acquired the Marshall Field’s stores and brand. When, roughly a year and a half later, it was announced that the stores would be rebranded as Macy’s, many Marshall Field’s customers were outraged. Customers felt an emotional connection with the store, and many protested the decision to change the name. However, management at Macy’s didn’t change their mind.</p>

<p>One of main benefits of the internet revolution of the last several decades is the democratization of communication. Compared with the Gilded Age - when news moved at the speed of printing presses - today’s consumers have no shortage of opportunities to let others know if they liked, or disliked their experience with a company, product, or service. And this is generally a good thing. It allows customers to benefit from the experiences and insights of others. However, it can present a challenge to any business trying to collect, interpret, and respond to its customers’ feedback. The goal of this article is to demonstrate three ways in which businesses can identify and benefit from the most relevant customer feedback through qualifying the popular slogan. In honor of the American store most responsible for popularizing the slogan, these examples are drawn from customer reviews of Macy’s.</p>

<h2 id="some-customer-complaints-are-more-common-than-others">Some Customer Complaints Are More Common Than Others</h2>

<p>Department stores and complaining customers and  go hand-in-hand. It’s like having a crying baby on an airplane and disgruntled passengers. One is generally not found without the other. But some customer complaints are more prevelant than others.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, this data suggests that people shop at Macy’s for the combination of quality goods at affordable prices, at a convenient location. Many of the words commonly associated with customer service such as Associate, Management, Help, Register, Delivery, and Returns, are more frequently found in negative reviews. This might mean that customers were more likely to mentioned a specific interaction with an employee if they had a negative shopping experience. Going department by department, there is a lot of variation, with the shoes department scoring the highest, several departments scoring as neutral - Bedding, Purses, and Furniture, for instance - and Jewelry scoring the lowest.</p>

<h2 id="some-customer-feedback-is-more-useful-than-others">Some Customer Feedback Is More Useful Than Others</h2>

<iframe src="http://bl.ocks.org/josiahdavis/raw/ba23b5ebf0ed1b8d3eb2/" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" height="500px" width="960px" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>In many cases, customers leave feedback with good intentions. They want the business to know what they really need, and they want to help others be more educated consumers. Unfortunately, not all customer feedback is equally useful. Some customers simply don’t have much to say. One customer’s entire review consisted of the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Really an enjoyable Macy’s. not too big but has all your needs. Customer service is also good!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other customers use social media as platforms for personal catharsis rather than collective good. For instance, one despondent customer said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Macy’s is not Marshall Fields, nor will it ever be. Maybe it is more like Marshall’s, without the low prices…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While many factors determine how useful a review may or may not be, one thing is clear: all human beings are vulnerable to letting one aspect of an experience bias their opinion of all aspects of their experience. This is commonly referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect">Halo Effect</a>. Perhaps this is one reason why there are more useful 2, 3, and 4 star reviews, than 1 and 5 star reviews.</p>

<h2 id="some-customers-are-more-nuanced-than-others">Some Customers Are More Nuanced Than Others</h2>

<iframe src="http://bl.ocks.org/josiahdavis/raw/50946dff7a73f23a2335/" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" height="960px" width="960px" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>The Halo Effect can be assessed by looking at the association between the sentiment contained in the text and the overall rating of the review itself. A positive review that has entirely positive sentiment, or a negative review with entirely negative sentiment, may be a sign of what psychologists call exaggerated emotional coherence. For instance the following review, while quite lengthy doesn’t have a single positive statement in it:
&gt; “Macy’s Womens Shoes, What can I say…… I go there with my Mom shopping.  We were bombarded by sales people one after the other saying ““can I help you find something””.  (Even after we had been helped) How annoying. We Find the shoe we like and the sales rep goes to look for it in the back.  The wait for the show was almost 30 min.  By the time the rep returned we just wanted to leave. (And almost did)  The shoe didn’t fit and after the wait we had, we decided to get on with our lives and NOT waster another 1/2 hour or more waiting to find the next pair. Can you say E-F-F-I-C-I-E-N-C-Y. PLEASE do better next time.”</p>

<p>Conversely, positive sentiments within negative reviews and the negative sentiments within positive reviews should be given extra credence, since they are less likely to be the result of cognitive bias. For instance, this reviewer considered her experience to be generally negative, but that didn’t stop her from saying several positive things as well:
&gt; …I went prom dress shopping with my sister and we found 2 dresses that she loved. We decided to buy both of them so that we could take them both home to get my parents’ opinions. I went to return one of the dresses, with the original receipt, and they told me that I could only get partial store credit and partial cash. Apparently because my sister had used her Visa giftcard to pay for the dress, they wouldn’t give me cash for that portion of the return and would only give me store credit. The only reason they are even getting 2 stars is because I was able to find a few decently priced things after I shopped just about every rack in the store…</p>

<h2 id="balancing-customer-choice-and-innovation">Balancing Customer Choice And Innovation</h2>
<p>Henry Ford famously said “if I asked the customer what they wanted, they would have asked for faster horses.” And this attitude - that business leaders need to come up with original ideas - served him well for a time. In 1922, <a href="https://www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/hf/The_Innovator_and_Ford_Motor_Company.asp">half of America’s cars</a> were made by the Ford Motor Company. But that’s not the whole story. Ford was notoriously stubborn, and was slow to realize to that his Model T needed to be improved. For nearly 20 years, the Model T was the only car produced by the Ford Motor company. This gave time for competitors to catch up, and by 1936 the Ford Motor company trailed both General Motors and Chrysler Co. in sales.</p>

<p>When it comes to listening to feedback it’s easy to take an all-or-nothing approach. Business leaders would do well to avoid both extremes. In other words: The customer is always right, is right; but some customers are more right than others.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identifying common themes for the bubble chart was accomplished by using a custom dictionary of word patterns. The word patterns were defined after looking at the most frequent tokens after removing stopwords and identifying parts of speech. Colors are based off of the relative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf#Term_frequency_2">augmented term frequency</a> contained in negative (1-3 star) and positive (4-5 star) reviews.</li>
  <li>The positivity and negativity in the scatter charts are defined as the ratio of words with a general positive or negative association as normalized by the total number of words in the review itself. The sentiment is scored using an off-the-shelf sentiment lexicon created by <a href="http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/meetsaif.htm">Saif Mohammad</a> and implemented by <a href="http://www.matthewjockers.net/">Matthew Jockers</a>.</li>
